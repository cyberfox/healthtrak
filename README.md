iOS health stat tracker (blood pressure, weight, glucose, etc.)

...deprecated...

Well!  So much for that. :)  iOS 8 shipping with a health stat tracker makes this kind of unnecessary,
so I've opened up my repos for it, as another now unfortunately abandoned project.

My idea was to track medicines to take in a TODO style list, along with regular measurements to take, and
a history of them (mainly blood pressure, glucose, weight, and consistency of taking medicine).
